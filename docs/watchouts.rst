Watchouts
=========

Dynamo is still in alpha state and there are still some serious watchouts, that you should have in mind, when using it: 

* **Be aware of the User**: With Dynamo you are handing over a powerful tool to the user and there is a realistic chance that he breaks your overall data model.

* **Multiple Users changing the same model**: If multiple users are working on and changing the same model, this might create quite some trouble, and currently this is neither prevented nor somenow handled by Dynamo.

* `Sophisticated Model Migrations <http://dynamic-models.readthedocs.org/en/latest/topics/model-migration.html#topics-model-migration>`_

* `Timing of Admin Updates <http://dynamic-models.readthedocs.org/en/latest/topics/admin-migration.html#timing-admin-updates>`_
